## **Checklist**

#### FIXED
- [x] color picker not hidden when group is selected
- [x] button positions not updated on windows resize
- [x] moving symbol out of canvas causes symbol not to show up and mouseup event is never triggered while mouse is off canvas
- [x] color picker color selecting screen not hidden onblur
- [x] color picker color selecting screen does not select color when clicked, only onmousemove
- [x] layer priority is inverted (top layer is decided on a descending fashion)
- [x] last selected symbol can still be moved when a group is selected (it should not be interactive)
- [x] when layer is moved, it loses interactivity (should re-activate it)
- [x] moving symbols by group not implemented
- [x] vertices not rounded to nearest integer
- [x] display at top on space press and hold
- [x] highlighting layers by group does not work for groups containing subgroups
- [x] symbol art BGE implementation
- [x] fix vertex orientation of quads (orientation is horizontally inverted)
- [x] moving elem into a subgroup and removing it apparently removes element from its previous group
- [x] deleting groups with nested subgroups is malfunctioning (does not delete some quads)
- [x] alpha not implemented (bug detected on the third party .SAML to .SAR converter application that impedes itself from interpreting alpha values correctly. This application then chose to apply 0-7 scale on SAML alpha output)
- [x] do not let user move a group inside itself
- [x] rename context menu access key value should not be passed to input tag
- [x] SHOULD NOT rename if name is unchanged
- [x] PREVENT CTRL+S DEFAULT save .html
- [x] disable undo/redo buttons after loading a valid .saml file
- [x] moving last layer in group into another group causes bug (currLayerInSrc is incorrrect = undefined) when undoing
- [x] missing symbol resources (not added yet)
- [x] correct layer name validation (regex for all char but special ones) in list and samlloader
- [x] saml load without name in span (span is from the new DOM design)
- [x] click hideUI button after loading saml
- [x] select mainfolder after loading saml
- [x] undo/redo GROUP move (for moving group of symbols)
- [x] update edit box position after resetting pan
- [x] fix jagged movement of group of symbolls at first time moving a group
- [x] select group, then right click layer doesnt select layer when it should (right click should select)
- [x] rename input tag should blur on click out
- [x] spacebar highlight on group, then move the group causes bug
- [x] list of symbols not implemented
- [x] list buttons do not display the symbol type preview
- [x] include chosen BGE in SAML output
- [x] layer color correction is not 100% correct (color in application does not always match color in game)
- [x] only close group after second click while it is the selected element
- [x] adding new layer in list view does not correctly highlight and select the newly created layer
- [x] highlighting layer/group does not work correctly in various cases
	- when adding, moving, removing, undo/redoing . . .
- [x] hide/show layer/group
	- disable all interaction when hidden
- [x] change color then select another layer while color picker is open causes newly selected layer to change color as well
- [x] check file format
- [x] hide symbol edit box while user is moving a layer in editor
- [x] on resize, change UI of toolbar to the best fit for given resolution. Create more rows to reduce row length

#### TO BE FIXED
- [ ] undo add when elem added is hidden and is the only child in group causes group to remain hidden
- [ ] comfirm exit when unsaved changes (medium priority)
- [ ] symbol limits (medium priority)
	- max symbol size (the biggest it can ever get)
	- canvas bounding box (impacts stretches, resizes, moves, rotations)
- [ ] max number of layers
- [ ] layer manager header displays layer count (for instance: 100 / 225)
- [ ] up/down arrows change active elem on same group (low priority)
- [ ] right/left arrows go in and out of groups (low priority)
- [ ] actionManager class for managing calls to perform functions and push actions to history. Every class that calls to perform some action will use this class as medium instead.
- [ ] add option to output result to image file (rethink)
- [ ] group edit box (rethink)
