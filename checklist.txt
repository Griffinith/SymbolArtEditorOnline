BUGS

// FIXED
- color picker not hidden when group is selected (X)
- button positions not updated on windows resize (X)
- moving symbol out of canvas causes symbol not to show up and mouseup event is never triggered while mouse is off canvas (X)
- color picker color selecting screen not hidden onblur (X)
- color picker color selecting screen does not select color when clicked, only onmousemove (X)
- layer priority is inverted (top layer is decided on a descending fashion) (X)
- last selected symbol can still be moved when a group is selected (it should not be interactive) (X)
- when layer is moved, it loses interactivity (should re-activate it)
- (X) moving symbols by group not implemented
- (X) vertices not rounded to nearest integer
- (X) display at top on space press and hold
- (X) moving layers by group does not work for groups containing subgroups
- (X) highlighting layers by group does not work for groups containing subgroups

// TO BE FIXED
- alpha not implemented
- list of symbols not implemented
- list buttons do not display the symbol type preview
- symbol art BGE not implemented
- moving elem into a subgroup and removing it apparently removes element from its previous group
- layer color correction is not 100% correct (color in application does not always match color in game)
- group folder expand/collapse only on click of the + icon (rethink)
