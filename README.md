Inspired by the in-game feature from Phantasy Star Online 2 (SEGA), 
this Symbol Art Editor is a browser image editor used to produce digital art made of symbols.
This is purely a fan-made application developed to let other fans and  have fun crafting symbol artwork outside of the game in a dedicated user-friendly editor engineered to be quick to use and that minimizes effort and repetition required to create quality symbol art. The only profit I expect from this application is people's happiness.

##### Currently under development, but available for testing and usage at your own risk and by your own curiosity.
##### Tell me your ideas if you think about an extra feature I have not thought about already. Also, if you have knowledge about how *.sar* files are formatted, please enlighten me so I can add support for it.
